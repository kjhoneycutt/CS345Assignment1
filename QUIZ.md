	By commiting your code to a repository you can save different versions of the code,
	which helps with version control, and also allows you to change different parts of
	the code and test it. This means you do not have to keep track of different versions
	manualy, and you can easily save parts of your code at different times, and then
	combine some or all of those parts when it's ready.
