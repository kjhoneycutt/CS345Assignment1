1. Explain how git enables saving code.
	By commiting your code to a repository you can save different versions of the code,
	which helps with version control, and also allows you to change different parts of
	the code and test it. This means you do not have to keep track of different versions
	manualy, and you can easily save parts of your code at different times, and then
	combine some or all of those parts when it's ready.
2. Explain how git enables tracking code.
	Because it enables version control, you can easily see how you've changed files and
	code in the past. It also allows you to see how other people have changed the code,
	which can give you useful information.
3. Explain how git enables sharing code.
	Other people can edit different parts of the code simultaneously, and upload their
	individual parts of the code as they complete their assingments. It also allows you
	to track how different collaborators have changed the code, and allows branches of
	editing, so groups of people can work on one part of the code together.
